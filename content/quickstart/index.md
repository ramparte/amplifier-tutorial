Get up and running with Amplifier in minutes. This section provides fast-track paths to productivity, whether you're exploring, building, or deploying. Follow these guides to go from zero to working application with minimal friction.

## Section Contents

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Installation](./installation.md) | Install Amplifier and dependencies |
